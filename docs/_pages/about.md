#### Arturo Joya
As a chess aficionado, I took on the challenge of creating this chess board implementation to better understand how python can facilitate the implementation of this game.  


#### Drew Pang
I wanted to implement something that required "clever" programming. When I'm doing projects with more utility, I know that I will be able to draw from the things I learned during this project, like object oriented programming.   


#### Omar Salih
I personally felt that chess would be really interesting to implement in python, and that this project would be a great opportunity to challenge myself in terms of scope and learning new things. Implementing this website in Jekyll and learning to take in user input via the controller class were two very important things I learned during this project.
