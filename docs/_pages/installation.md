## A Gentle Forewarning
*Note - this chess board implementation has only been tested for gameplay in a Conda Environment in Ubuntu 20.04 and there is no guarantee that this implementation will work beyond its noted intended use and tested environments.*
*The following instructions are written for installation, testing, and gameplay in the terminal.*
## Step 1 - Clone
Make sure to clone this (embed link to repo) repository to your local machine by running this command in a directory of your choice `git clone git@github.com:olincollege/baba-chess.git` 
## Step 2 - Python Dependencies
The only external library used in this implementation is `Pytest`, which was used only to test the code. If you donâ€™t know whether or not you have pytest installed, run the command `pip install -U pytest`.

Note, testing the code is not necessary for gameplay; however, it is provided as a means to validate the functionality of this code and help curious players understand the edge cases that this code implementation was designed to handle.
## Step 3 (optional) - Testing the Code
To test the code, make sure that you are in the directory where your clone of this repository lives, and run the command `pytest`. If there are no errors, you should get the following screen.

```bash

The current revision of this chess board relies heavily on your
knowledge of chess.
Notably, enpassant captures, castling, and promotions have not
been implemented into this version; however, progress is being
made towards improving this chess board.
