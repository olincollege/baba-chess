title: Chess in Python?
permalink: /

Welcome to BabaChess - your neighborhood, cheap, knock-off version of a text-based chess board that you can run on Python (and only Python). Don’t know how to play chess? Don’t worry, we won’t teach you - will we call you out on it though? Heck yeah!

```bash
Not a legal move!
Error: 'e2-e5' is not a valid move. Input a new move.
Input your move ie. ('e2-e4'/undo/quit):
```

Show off to your friends that you can really play chess by avoiding these illegal-move errors (or don’t, that’s fine).  

Our chess board supports the following functions:

* In terminal gameplay

* Basic piece movements

* LAN Coordinate inputs

* Undo


The text based format allows us to display our game pieces in many different environments (especially those that may not support glyphs like the linux terminal). The following is a legend to how our pieces are named and what they represent.
