Welcome to Baba Chess  - your neighborhood, cheap, knock-off version of a text-based chess board that you can run on Python (and only Python). Don’t know how to play chess? Don’t worry, we won’t teach you - will we call you out on it though? Heck yeah!

`Not a legal move!`

Show off to your friends that you can really play chess by avoiding these illegal-move errors (or don’t, that’s fine).  
Our chess board supports the following functions:
* In terminal gameplay
* Basic piece movements {insert image}
* LAN Coordinate inputs {insert image}
* Undo


The text based format allows us to display our game pieces in many different environments (especially those that may not support glyphs like the linux terminal). The following is a legend to how our pieces are named and what they represent.

(Insert Table here)

Check out sample gameplay here:
